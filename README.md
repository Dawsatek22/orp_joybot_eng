This is a project to make orb-joybot.A joystick controlled(xbox one controller for this example but you can tweak it with other bluetooth controlled joystick like ps4)
raspberry Pi 2wheeled robot in c++.

The project is assembled with 3d printed parts from open robotic platform(link here :)but code can also used(at your own volition) to build your own custom robot.

This projects is coded in a vscode editor but can be also coded in a another ide if you want. This project uses power supply from 5v to 12v so be careful.
